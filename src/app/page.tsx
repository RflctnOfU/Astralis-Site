            The Astralis Chamber Ensemble is an innovative and dynamic ensemble
            performing with much acclaim across the globe. Through creative
            programming and presentations on the works performed, Astralis aims
            to make classical music more accessible and for audiences to make a
            lasting connection to the music. Concert tours are arranged to
            include rural communities and reach audiences without access to
            classical music. These award-winning musicians represent decades of
            experience across many of the worldâ€™s major venues and notable
            concert series. With instrument pairings that are unique worldwide,
            the ensemble expands the repertoire available through commissions
            and arrangements. ACE aims to support the development of the arts
            through new compositions and reach communities of all backgrounds
            through music.
