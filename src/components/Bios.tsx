            Laura Usiskin enjoys a versatile career as a cellist and educator.
            Her playing has taken her to concert halls throughout the United
            States and Europe, including the Kennedy Center, Palazzo Chigi

            Zankel Hall, Merkin Hall, Miller Theatre, Barge Music, Steinway

            more than 10 years old, has given intensive string instruction to
            hundreds of low-income children across three counties. Usiskin is a
            member of the Bayberry String Quartet as well as the Atlanta-based
            new music group ensemble vim. She has served on the faculty of the
            University of Alabama at Birmingham, through which she founded the
            chamber series Chamber Music @ AEIVA, as well as Birmingham-Southern

            Hilary Glen has been praised as a “standout performer” who has
            successfully “taken on the demanding and most expressive
            responsibilities assigned to the instrument.” She enjoys a varied
            career of teaching and performing. Performances have taken her
            around the world from the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall in the US
            to the Concertgebouw in the Netherlands, to Bunkamura Orchard Hall
            in Japan. After maintaining a fulfilling orchestral schedule for
            many years, Dr. Glen has turned her focus to chamber music, touring
            with her duo, Gibbs St. Duo, which was formed with the mission to
            bring awareness to disregarded composers. She currently serves on
            the faculty of Indiana University and the Hochstein School of Music.
            With a mission to promote inclusive and intentional programming, she
            regularly curates interactive chamber music events that feature the
            works of historically excluded composers. She has presented her
            research at National Conferences for the College Music Society and
            at the inaugural 2023 Context Conference at the Eastman School of
            Music. Dr. Glen completed her BM at Indiana University with Janos
            Starker. She earned her MM and DMA with Alan Harris at the Eastman
            School of Music.
